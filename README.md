## What is FailSafe?
FailSafe is a VS Code extension that aims to provide a passive safety net for AI-assisted development. It is committed to strict realism, user trust, and zero hallucination in both its features and its reporting.

### Key Principles
- **Validate Chat** is a default, non-removable rule. On startup, FailSafe will check for its presence in `.cursorrules` and restore it if missing.
- **Dashboard Data:** If no validation events have occurred, dashboard will display "No data yet"—never sample or fake data.
- **Ambiguity, Drift, Hallucination:** Top priorities for detection and rule triggers.
- **Cursor Integration:** Plans to leverage Cursor's background agents, task/agent features, and queued prompts for sprint planning.
- **Versioning:** Version bumps will prompt for branch creation and issue filing, not auto-commit to main. No direct pushes to main branch.

## Commitment
FailSafe is committed to zero hallucination, strict realism, and user trust. All features and data are clearly marked by status. The Validate Chat rule is the foundation of the passive validation system and is always enforced. Dashboard and analytics only reflect real, logged data. Ambiguity, drift, and hallucination detection are top priorities for rules and triggers. Cursor integration and background agent workflows are being actively explored, with user control and transparency as guiding principles.

3. **Implementation Verification** - Flags unverified implementation claims
4. **Completion Validation** - Checks task completion assertions
5. **Performance Analysis** - Validates performance and optimization claims

### Smart Detection
The system intelligently identifies content that needs validation:

- **AI Response Patterns** - Recognizes typical AI response structures
- **Claim Detection** - Identifies statements that make specific claims
- **Context Awareness** - Considers the context of the content being validated
- **Risk Assessment** - Prioritizes validation based on potential impact

### Non-Intrusive Feedback
When issues are detected, FailSafe provides feedback without interrupting your workflow:

- **HTML Comments** - Adds invisible feedback to webview content
- **Inline Notices** - Subtle indicators in text responses
- **Optional Notifications** - Configurable notification system
- **Detailed Reports** - Comprehensive validation results when requested
