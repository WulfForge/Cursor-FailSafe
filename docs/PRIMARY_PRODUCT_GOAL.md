# FailSafe Primary Product Goal

## Core Mission
FailSafe is designed as a **passive safety net** for non-code proficient developers (vibe coders) to prevent problems they wouldn't even know to look for.

## Key Principles

### 1. Passive Protection
- **No proactive intervention required** - the tool works in the background
- **Automatic detection** of common issues that non-technical users wouldn't recognize
- **Seamless integration** into existing workflows without disruption

### 2. Vibe Coder Focus
- **Target audience**: Developers who may lack deep technical knowledge
- **Problem prevention**: Catch issues before they become problems
- **Educational value**: Help users learn about potential risks through passive exposure

### 3. Safety Net Philosophy
- **Preventative rather than reactive** - stop problems before they happen
- **Comprehensive coverage** - address multiple types of issues simultaneously
- **Non-intrusive** - provide protection without overwhelming the user

## Product Implications

### CursorRules Evolution Needed
- **Expand beyond single rule types** - support comprehensive pattern detection
- **Passive validation** - run checks automatically without user intervention
- **Context-aware filtering** - understand when and how to apply rules
- **Educational feedback** - explain why certain patterns are flagged

### User Experience Priorities
- **Zero learning curve** - works without configuration
- **Non-blocking** - doesn't interrupt workflow
- **Invisible when working well** - only surfaces when there's an actual issue
- **Clear, non-technical explanations** when issues are found

## Success Metrics
- **Reduced preventable errors** in codebases
- **Increased confidence** for non-technical developers
- **Seamless adoption** without training requirements
- **Proactive issue prevention** rather than reactive fixes

## Future Development Focus
- **Expanded rule library** covering common development pitfalls
- **Intelligent pattern recognition** beyond simple regex matching
- **Contextual awareness** of project types and user skill levels
- **Passive learning** that improves over time based on usage patterns
