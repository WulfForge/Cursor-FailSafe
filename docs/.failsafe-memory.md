# FailSafe Project Memory

## Core Principles & Best Practices

- **Planning-first, memory-driven workflow:** Spend 75â€“80% of time in structured, AI-assisted planning before implementation. Implementation is blocked until planning is reviewed and approved.
- **Persistent project memory:** This file stores and updates project knowledge, architecture, conventions, and solutions. Reference and update before major changes.
- **Custom command automation:** Support user-defined, markdown-based workflow commands for repeatable, multi-step processes (planned).
- **Self-evaluation and optimizer loops:** After code generation or validation, automatically grade and iteratively improve output until a quality threshold is met (planned).
- **Parallel agent/task execution:** Enable multiple validation, planning, or code generation agents to run in parallel for increased productivity (planned).
- **Live documentation/resource integration:** Require checking and referencing up-to-date documentation/resources before building features (planned).
- **Zero hallucination policy:** No fake/sample data. Dashboards always show 'No data yet' if appropriate. All features and data are clearly marked as Implemented, Planned, Aspirational, or Flagged.
- **Enforced, non-removable safety rules:** Validate Chat and Workspace Safety rules are always present and enforced on startup. Destructive actions are blocked unless backup and directory are confirmed.
- **Version consistency is critical:** Always check and synchronize version numbers across all key files before release or packaging.
- **Ambiguity, drift, and hallucination detection:** These are top priorities for rules and triggers.
- **Cursor integration and versioning best practices:** Never auto-commit to main; always prompt for branch/PR/issue creation. Use background agents for PRs, branch creation, and actionable follow-ups.

## Lessons Learned & Context

- Version consistency across CHANGELOG.md, README.md, and package.json is a critical release requirement. Auto-fix and warn if mismatches are detected.
- Block all destructive commands unless a full workspace backup is verified and directory is confirmed. This rule is non-removable.
- Validate Chat is a default, non-removable rule. On startup, FailSafe checks for its presence and restores it if missing.
- Dashboard and analytics only reflect real, logged data. If no validation events have occurred, display 'No data yet.'
- Ambiguity, drift, and hallucination detection are top priorities for rules and triggers.
- Background agents should handle PRs, branch creation, and actionable follow-ups. Never auto-commit to main; always prompt for branch creation and issue filing.

## Current Architecture & Conventions

- **Backend:** Fastify server with modular plugins for validation, analytics, and preview.
- **Validation:** Rule-driven, with comprehensive triple rule system:
  - `.failsafe/cursorrules.json` - Core FailSafe rules (source of truth)
  - `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` - Cursor project rules (32 rules implemented with YAML frontmatter)
  - `CursorRules` - Natural language user rules for Cursor guidance
- **Core Rules:** Two non-removable rules (Validate Chat, Workspace Safety) enforced by all systems
- **Wizard Integration:** Rule creation wizard now creates rules in all three systems simultaneously
- **UI:** Modern dashboard, real-time analytics (Chart.js), and preview system.
- **Planning:** All major changes require review and update of this memory file.

## Recent Implementations

### Triple Rule System Implementation (2024-12-30)
- **Fixed Format:** All 32 `.mdc` files now use correct YAML frontmatter format
- **Implemented:** Comprehensive triple rule system:
  - FailSafe internal rules (`.failsafe/cursorrules.json`)
  - Cursor project rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) with proper YAML frontmatter
  - Cursor user rules (`CursorRules`) in natural language format
- **Wizard Enhancement:** Rule creation wizard now creates rules in all three systems simultaneously
- **Core Rules:** Validate Chat and Workspace Safety are non-removable and enforced by all systems
- **Categories:** Hallucination detection, validation, workflow, safety, and verification pipeline rules
- **Integration:** Rules are now visible in Cursor's project rule UI and enforced by both FailSafe and Cursor
- **Auto-Deployment:** FailSafe installation automatically deploys rules to all three systems

## To Do / Planned Enhancements

- Implement user-defined workflow commands (markdown-based).
- Add self-evaluation and optimizer loops for code and validation outputs.
- Enable parallel agent/task execution for validation, planning, and code generation.
- Integrate live documentation/resource checks before building features.
- Continue to enforce and update zero hallucination policy and safety rules.
