# o3-Accountable Design Document

## Project Overview
**FailSafe Extension for Cursor AI** - A comprehensive AI safety and validation system designed to prevent hallucinations, ensure code quality, and maintain project accountability.

## Core Mission
To provide real-time validation and safety checks for AI-generated content while maintaining transparency and accountability in development workflows.

## Key Principles

### 1. Transparency
- All validation results are clearly documented
- Users have full visibility into what is being checked
- No hidden processes or undisclosed validations

### 2. Accountability
- Clear ownership of validation decisions
- Traceable audit trail for all actions
- Responsibility for false positives/negatives

### 3. Safety First
- Prioritize preventing harmful or incorrect outputs
- Comprehensive validation of AI responses
- Multiple layers of safety checks

### 4. User Control
- Users can customize validation rules
- Clear opt-out mechanisms where appropriate
- Respect for user preferences and workflows

## Technical Architecture

### Validation Pipeline
1. **Input Validation**: Check AI responses for basic safety
2. **Content Analysis**: Validate claims and implementations
3. **Code Quality**: Ensure generated code meets standards
4. **Security Review**: Identify potential security issues
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear audit trails

### Core Components
- **Validator**: Main validation engine
- **CursorRules**: Custom validation rules
- **Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring interface
- **Fastify Server**: Backend services and APIs
- **Task Engine**: Project management integration

## Safety Measures

### AI Response Validation
- Hallucination detection
- Implementation claim verification
- File existence validation
- Code compilation checks
- Security vulnerability scanning

### Quality Assurance
- Code style enforcement
- Performance impact analysis
- Documentation completeness
- Test coverage validation

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Clear error messages
- Recovery mechanisms
- Fallback options

## Accountability Framework

### Audit Trail
- All validations logged with timestamps
- User actions tracked and documented
- Decision rationale preserved
- Performance metrics collected

### Transparency Reports
- Regular validation statistics
- False positive/negative analysis
- Performance impact assessment
- User feedback integration

### User Rights
- Access to all validation logs
- Ability to challenge decisions
- Customization of validation rules
- Clear opt-out mechanisms

## Compliance Standards

### Data Privacy
- No personal data collection
- Local processing where possible
- Clear data handling policies
- User consent for any data sharing

### Security
- Secure validation processes
- No code execution without consent
- Safe file system access
- Protected configuration storage

### Accessibility
- Full keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast support
- Multiple language support

## Success Metrics

### Validation Accuracy
- False positive rate < 5%
- False negative rate < 2%
- Response time < 3 seconds
- Coverage > 95% of AI responses

### User Satisfaction
- Positive feedback > 80%
- Feature adoption > 60%
- Support requests < 10/month
- User retention > 90%

### Performance Impact
- Editor startup time < 1 second
- Memory usage < 50MB
- CPU usage < 5% during validation
- No impact on typing performance

## Future Roadmap
