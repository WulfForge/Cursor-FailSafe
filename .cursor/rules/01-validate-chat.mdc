# Validate Chat

## Purpose
validate_chat

## Enforcement
- **Always Active:** This rule cannot be disabled or removed
- **Scope:** All chat interactions
- **Action:** Validate all responses for accuracy and truthfulness

## Validation Criteria
- **Hallucination Detection:** Check for claims about files, code, or data that don't exist
- **Ambiguity Detection:** Identify vague or unclear statements
- **Drift Detection:** Ensure responses stay on topic and don't deviate from the original question

## Implementation Notes
This is a core safety rule that ensures all AI responses are grounded in reality and the actual workspace state.
