# Compilation Status Claim

**Rule Type:** Regex Pattern  
**Severity:** Warning  
**Pattern:** `\b(?:compiles|builds|runs|executes)\s+(?:successfully|without\s+errors)\b`

## Description
Validates compilation and build status claims to ensure accuracy.

## Purpose
compilation_status

## Pattern Matches
- "compiles successfully"
- "builds without errors"
- "runs successfully"
- "executes without errors"

## Validation Required
When this pattern is detected, verify:
1. The code actually compiles
2. The build process completed successfully
3. No errors were encountered

## Response
- **Warning Level:** Flag for compilation verification
- **Action:** Suggest build testing
- **Fallback:** Encourage running the build process

## Implementation Notes
This rule prevents false claims about compilation success without actual testing.
