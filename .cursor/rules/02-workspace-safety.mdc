# Workspace Safety

## Purpose
safety

## Enforcement
- **Always Active:** This rule cannot be disabled or removed
- **Scope:** All destructive file operations
- **Action:** Block execution until backup verification

## Protected Commands
- `delete` - File deletion operations
- `remove` - File removal operations  
- `rm` - Unix-style remove command
- `del` - Windows-style delete command

## Safety Requirements
Before allowing any destructive operation:
1. **Backup Verification:** Confirm a full workspace backup exists
2. **Directory Confirmation:** Verify the correct directory is being operated on
3. **User Confirmation:** Require explicit user approval

## Implementation Notes
This is a core safety rule that prevents accidental data loss and ensures workspace integrity.
