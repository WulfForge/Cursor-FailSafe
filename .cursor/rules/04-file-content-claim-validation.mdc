# File Content Claim Validation

## Purpose
hallucination_detection

## Pattern Matches
- "content in file"
- "text of document"
- "data from file"

## Validation Required
When this pattern is detected, verify:
1. The file actually exists
2. The content claim is accurate
3. The file has been read and verified

## Response
- **Error Level:** Flag as potential hallucination
- **Action:** Require file content verification
- **Fallback:** Read and display actual file content

## Implementation Notes
This rule ensures AI doesn't make false claims about file contents without verification.
