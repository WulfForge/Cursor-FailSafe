# Filesystem Hallucination Detection

## Purpose
hallucination_detection

## Pattern Matches
- "file exists"
- "directory is present" 
- "folder can be found"
- "path is available"

## Validation Required
When this pattern is detected, verify:
1. The file/directory actually exists in the workspace
2. The path is correct and accessible
3. The claim is based on actual file system state

## Response
- **Error Level:** Flag as potential hallucination
- **Action:** Require verification before proceeding
- **Fallback:** Use file system APIs to confirm existence

## Implementation Notes
This rule helps prevent AI from making false claims about file system state.
