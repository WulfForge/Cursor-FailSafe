# File Modification Time Claim

## Purpose
hallucination_detection

## Pattern Matches
- "modified on"
- "updated at"
- "changed when"

## Validation Required
When this pattern is detected, verify:
1. The file actually exists
2. The modification time claim is accurate
3. File system metadata has been checked

## Response
- **Error Level:** Flag as potential hallucination
- **Action:** Require file metadata verification
- **Fallback:** Check actual file modification time

## Implementation Notes
This rule prevents AI from making false claims about when files were last modified.
