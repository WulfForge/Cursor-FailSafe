# CursorRules Wizard Requirements & Design (FailSafe)

## Purpose
The Rules Wizard guides users through creating effective, testable validation rules for AI content and code, supporting FailSafe's zero-hallucination and strict realism goals.

---

## Core Principles
- **Validate Chat Rule:** Always present, default, non-removable. On startup, FailSafe checks for its presence in `.cursorrules` and restores it if missing.
- **Prompt Integrity:** Users must confirm the intent and clarity of each rule. The wizard will prompt for confirmation and flag ambiguous or overly broad rules.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Recommend clear, specific, non-ambiguous rules
  - Warn against vague, generic, or overly broad patterns
  - Provide examples and inline help
- **Zero Hallucination:** Only rules present in `.cursorrules` are enforced. No fake or sample rules/data.

---

## Wizard Steps
1. **Rule Type Selection**
   - Pattern Match (regex/keyword)
   - Claim Detection (implementation, completion, performance, etc.)
   - File/Version Consistency
   - Custom/Advanced
2. **Pattern/Condition Definition**
   - Enter regex, keywords, or select from templates
   - For claims: choose or define claim type/phrase
   - Inline help and examples
3. **Severity & Action**
   - Set priority (High/Medium/Low)
   - Choose action: Warn, Block, Log, Suggest
   - Explain impact of each action
4. **Test Rule**
   - Provide sample input to test rule matching
   - Show match results and highlight issues
   - Warn if rule is too broad or never matches
5. **Summary & Save**
   - Review rule details
   - User must confirm clarity and intent
   - Save to `.cursorrules` (append or update, maintaining priority order)

---

## Startup Enforcement
- On extension startup, FailSafe checks `.cursorrules` for the Validate Chat rule.
- If missing, it is auto-added as the first rule.
- The Validate Chat rule cannot be removed or disabled by the user.

---

## .cursorrules File Format (JSON)
```json
[
  {
    "type": "pattern",
    "pattern": "hardcoded password",
    "patternType": "keyword",
    "severity": "high",
    "action": "block",
    "description": "Block hardcoded passwords"
  },
  {
    "type": "claim",
    "claimType": "implementation",
    "pattern": "implemented",
    "severity": "medium",
    "action": "warn",
    "description": "Warn on unverified implementation claims"
  }
]
```
- Each rule must include: type, pattern/condition, severity, action, description.
- Future extensibility: allow for triggers, workflow actions, advanced pattern types.

---

## UI/UX Design
- Simple, step-by-step wizard
- Inline help, examples, and warnings
- Prompt for confirmation at each step
- Highlight best practices and flag risky patterns
- Show test results before saving

---

## Integration & Extensibility
- The rules engine loads `.cursorrules` and applies all rules to chat/code content.
- Future: allow rules to trigger additional actions (e.g., create task, escalate, notify).
- Reference Cursor's best practices for agent/task rules (e.g., PR templates, actionable follow-ups, clear notifications).

---

## Supporting Zero-Hallucination & Roadmap Goals
- The wizard ensures only real, user-defined rules are enforced.
- No sample or fake rules/data are ever used.
- All dashboard and analytics data are based on actual rule matches.
- The Validate Chat rule is always present, ensuring baseline validation and supporting the passive safety system.
- The design supports future roadmap goals: extensible, user-driven, and tightly integrated with Cursor's evolving agent/task features.
