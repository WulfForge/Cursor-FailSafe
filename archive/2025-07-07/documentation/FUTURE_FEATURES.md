- [ ] **Feature Mapping**: Create a map of UI elements to backend functionality
- [ ] **Preservation Verification**: Verify each feature works after UI changes
- [ ] **Regression Testing**: Test all user workflows after UI updates
- [ ] **Documentation Update**: Update feature documentation to reflect UI changes

#### 2. Incremental Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Feature-by-Feature Testing**: Test each feature individually after UI changes
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Verify features work together after updates
- [ ] **User Workflow Testing**: Test complete user journeys end-to-end
- [ ] **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensure UI works across different environments
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Verify UI changes don't impact performance

#### 3. Backup Strategy
- [ ] **Feature-Specific Backups**: Create backups of feature implementations before major UI overhauls
- [ ] **Version Control**: Use git branches for UI experiments
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to quickly revert to previous UI
- [ ] **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to gradually roll out UI changes
- [ ] **Staging Environment**: Test UI changes in staging before production

#### 4. Automated Testing
- [ ] **UI Component Tests**: Add tests for individual UI components
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Test UI-backend integration points
- [ ] **End-to-End Tests**: Automate complete user workflow testing
- [ ] **Visual Regression Tests**: Detect unintended UI changes
- [ ] **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure UI remains accessible after changes

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Before UI Changes
1. **Create Feature Inventory**: List all current features and their UI elements
2. **Document Dependencies**: Map UI elements to backend functionality
3. **Set Up Testing**: Ensure automated tests are in place
4. **Create Backup Branch**: Branch off current working state

#### During UI Changes
1. **Incremental Updates**: Make small, testable changes
2. **Continuous Testing**: Run tests after each change
3. **Feature Verification**: Manually verify each feature works
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update docs as you go

#### After UI Changes
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Run full test suite
2. **User Acceptance Testing**: Have users test the new UI
3. **Performance Validation**: Ensure no performance regressions
4. **Documentation Review**: Update all relevant documentation

### Tools and Resources
