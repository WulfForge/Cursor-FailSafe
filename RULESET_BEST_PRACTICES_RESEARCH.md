- **Specific Triggers**: Avoid overly broad patterns that generate false positives
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Define success metrics for each rule type
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of rule logic and purpose

#### **Context Awareness**
- **Project-Specific**: Rules should adapt to project type, language, and requirements
- **User Role**: Different rules for different user roles and experience levels
- **Temporal Context**: Consider conversation history and recent interactions
- **Risk Assessment**: Adjust rule sensitivity based on current risk level

#### **User Experience**
- **Clear Feedback**: Users should understand why a rule triggered
- **Actionable Guidance**: Provide specific steps to resolve issues
